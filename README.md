Customer 360 Data Aggregation Platform
A unified data platform that aggregates and normalizes customer information from multiple sources (CSV, JSON, etc.), stores the cleaned data in a PostgreSQL database, and exposes a FastAPI-based CRUD API for seamless access and management. Designed for data engineers, this project demonstrates robust ETL workflows, data quality standardization, and RESTful microservice architectureâ€”laying the foundation for customer analytics, segmentation, and personalization use cases.
